A tutorial on the [SemaText glossary page](https://sematext.com/glossary/kubernetes-quality-of-service-classes/) for Kubernetes beginners. 

The tutorial introduces the concept of Quality of service (QoS)classes and shows the learner how to correctly configure the QoS classes in a pod for resource management. 

This is one of the projects I worked on together with the platform enginners and documentation team to create several tutorials on Kubernetes tools and features.

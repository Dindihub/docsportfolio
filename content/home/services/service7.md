I am a member of the Write the Docs (WTD) community in Kenya and the USA one. I regularly engage with the community,post job and training opportunities as well as benefit from the opportunities shared. 

I contributed this [Open-source guide](https://wtdkenya.hashnode.dev/how-to-contribute-to-open-source-as-a-technical-writer) to the Kenya WTD on their Hashnode blog.

A user guide I wrote for [Earlyaccesshq.com](https://www.earlyaccesshq.com/resources/guide/how-to-create-a-waitlist-page). It makes it easier for users to optimize the product's advanced features to create a wailist tailored for business and marketing campaigns. 

The waitlist feature has enhanced customization options, settings, and payment integrations, fostering a branded and personalized marketing experience.

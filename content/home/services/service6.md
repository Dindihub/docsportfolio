My first open-source project contribution was at the AsyncAPI.I collaborated with the community to transcribe video content to create contribution guidelines for new users. 

An example is this one of [How to become a Technical Steering Committee](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/blob/master/TSC_MEMBERSHIP.md) (TSC) member at AsyncAPI.

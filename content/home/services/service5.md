This [project](https://github.com/Dindihub/TUF-docs-analysis/tree/main/analyses/0012-TUF) was part of the Linux Foundation mentorship program from June-August 2024.It included analyzing [The Update Framework](https://theupdateframework.io/) (TUF) documentation and providing improvement according to the CNCF standards. 

I worked with several mentors from CNCF and TUF to provide improvement to the current website which included creating a new website. See the [proposed version](https://deploy-preview-23--tufio.netlify.app/) here.
